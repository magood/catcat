there is a geo object which is None
id which is a long, id_str which is a string
DUDE there is even a lang attribute which was 'fr' when I made a stupid joke in french
text is unicode and is the WHOLE text including @atcatcat and url of image
user object includes a TON of stuff
	-Name (unicode, friendly)
	-profile_image_url
	-screen_name (user id)
	-url for user
mentions includes attributes max_id and since_id
entities[u'media'][0][u'media_url'] and then append ":large" or the value of [u'sizes'] that maximizes [u'sizes'][x][u'w']

One of the tweets has a place object...  geo & coordinates are still None.
	-place.bounding_box.coordinates[0] is an array of [lat,lng] (or lng,lat, not sure)
		-WKT should specify as LON LAT I think.
	-place.bounding_box.type shows up as u'Polygon'
	-place.country (name), place.country_code ('US'), place.full_name is best for geotagging probably (u'Orland Park, IL'), place.place_type is u'city' for this one...
	-there's a place.url there that you can get... something... for.  But you must be authenticated.
