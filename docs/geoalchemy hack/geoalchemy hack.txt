geoalchemy doesn't work with newer version of sqlalchemy - it must not be being updated often.
(They have moved on to v2 and probbably aren't supporting this)
Sooooo.... You have to hack the base.py in the virtualenv version (in lib/site-packages).
see reference base.py

Summary of changes:

Imports:
try:
    from sqlalchemy.sql.functions import Function
except ImportError:
    from sqlalchemy.sql.expression import Function  # sqlalchemy < 0.9
	
then throughout code change all cases of expression.function to function.

Then way down at the bottom:
class SpatialComparator(ColumnProperty.Comparator):
which used to be ColumnComparator or something.
